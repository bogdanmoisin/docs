# Elcodi Philosophy

One of the questions we are very used to responding is... why Elcodi and not any
other possible options?

This question is indeed bad formulated, so we've never based our philosophy in
being different from the others in a very explicit way, so the project just was
born thanks that, some years ago, none of the existing options filfilled our 
needs as a company and as a client. So, because of that, we decided to create a
new way of coding an E-commerce product.

We named it Elcodi.

For starting this chapter is fair enough to say that Elcodi goes a little futher
than a simple technological solution, so the basic needs of any technical
department are not covered only with a repository full of PHP code lines.
In Elcodi we aim to create a small foundation of thoughts and reflections
related completely with the code quality, with the software architecture and
with the open source, on top of pragmatism.

We bring you here some small topics.

## Clean Code

Yes. Clean Code. How super cool is saying *clean code*, right? As developers 
we've heard this expression hundreds of times, and seems that we never give it 
enough importance to what really means Clean Code on open source. The real 
meaning is the base of our principles, and for that reason all our code (at 
least that's our goal) must be enough clean, neat, organized and documented to
make it understandable by every single developer working on Elcodi.

- But the code should be self-explained!
- Indeed. That makes reference to the code quality. Variables well named, code
well structured (not everything in the same line, for example), well designed
blocks and classes and methods well named as well. Have you ever heard speak on
the context change problem? Clean Code should cover this topic as well.

Imagine that a developer is working with Elcodi as a dependency in his vendor
folder. As a developer, he should focus only in what is really important for
him, his business logic. The other code related to his work should be enough
clear, easy and fast to comprehend in order to focus as less as possible the
developer.

And you know what? People is intended to understand better the human language
than the code itself. This means that if you can provide an easy comprehension
layer for anyone that only what to know something about a class or a method,
then why not? You're reducing this annoying cost of focus change.

- With PHPDoc documentation, both in terms of class responsibility and method
definition
- With a great definition of method input and output
- With an even better nomenclature of methods
- Using normalization as much as possible
- Using PSR standards

Of course, all non-code-related must be removed in order to no create visual
noise and to not introduce ambiguity.

## Real pragmatism

We assume that to reach a goal there are always many ways. Some of them are can
be considered as good ways and could be treated as such. That's because each
possible implementation is the combination of a theoretical base and a set of
external realities far from being idyllic, for example, time, requirements and 
resources.

In Elcodi we think that these unfavorable conditions are always present around
us, so we have been working so far by simplifying and improving the user
experience, without forgetting about the complexity and the completeness of the
final project.

What does it really means?

- We want our code to be as much readable and understandable as possible
- We fled from complex architectures, forgetting about these structures that can
be too difficult for most part of the developers
- We are mainly focused on providing a grateful and kind experience. We want,
and is one of our most important points, reduce and mitigate the pain when
working with E-commerce.
- We are a Community-first project. This means that we are aware of how
difficult is starting with a new technology. We will there with you.

We work so hard to bring to the community the possibility to have a big voice.
We listen them everyday to concrete our roadmap, so they can actively
participate to the progress of the project

## Community first

One of our virtues is that the project was born from the community, we exist
because of the community and we strongly think that the community will be, at
the end, what will make Elcodi a successful project

Each developer interested in our project is (and will always be) a great
opportunity for us to improve our work, so it worth spending some time helping
people with the project, evangelizing our point of view, our way of doing and
sharing lot of knowledge and fun.

We spend part of our effort in creating new projects based in Elcodi, feeding
the community with new use cases, with new motivated developers on growing with
our philosophy and bringing people new and stronger reasons to share this path
with us.
