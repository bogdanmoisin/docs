# Roadmap

In Elcodi we've defined a very strict Roadmap definition. We will evolve as much
as possible next years, but we will never forget old Elcodi and Bamboo
installations, so our progress will be supplemented with tons of help and
support for all our customers.

During the minor versions, we encourage all installations to follow all updates
in order to get new features, but all issues will be merged in the lowest branch
possible.

Each new tag will be properly documented and comunicated.
