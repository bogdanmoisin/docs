# What is Elcodi

Welcome to Elcodi.

In this chapter we aim to explain you some basic internals about Elcodi and some
nice reasons about how this tool can be really useful if you're interested in
E-commerce and Symfony.

Elcodi is a project born in Barcelona in the year 2014 as an open source
project. At the beginning was born as an alternative of other existent projects
non-based on Symfony, to create in a very efficient and fast way E-commerce 
projects. After some months it became a nice and cool option in the Symfony
ecosystem.

The main goal of the project is propose a complete base to the final user
(developer) for building e-commerce projects, following some patterns and
thoughts, born to satisfy the developer and bring him a very painless, efficient
and fast working experience.

When we talk about Elcodi as a complete developing tool, we don't mean that we
provide all external implementations, integrations and bridges, but the project
itself is a platform and is thought to make all the community participant,
creating these integrations, using a great Plugin definition and implementation,
and feeding the ecosystem in a very healthy way.

* [Plugins](http://elcodi.io/docs/book/plugins/)

Elcodi proposes a set of common features, specially implemented to provide a
basic solution for all E-commerce implementation. Basic doesn't mean
insufficient nor incomplete, but essential.

* [Processes](http://elcodi.io/docs/book/processes/)

Of couse, in Elcodi, apart from offering all this technological material, we
want to provide our experience when implementing new feature in our code, adding
our way of working and our methodologies. This working method is based in a very
pragmatic thought, fleeing ephemeral and transient theories, and focusing on 
what is interesting in terms of developer and community.

We thought it important that your experience as a member, department or company
should be enough to make interesting and positive the fact of working with
Elcodi, so we have created a set of basic principles that we have as a project.

the way people is intended to work with concepts like Cart, Product or even
