# How to Implement a Collector

If you look for how to create a simple Collector by using components provided by
Symfony, you will find nothing. This guide will show you some light about how to
do it using existing Symfony code.

Please, read that article from [Marc Morera](http://mmoreram.com) called
[EventListeners as Collectors in Symfony](http://mmoreram.com/blog/2015/08/28/eventlisteners-as-collectors-in-symfony/)
that talks about how to implement a simple collector by using the Event 
Dispatcher symfony component.
